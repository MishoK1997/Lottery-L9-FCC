# Decentralized Lottery

This project is a decentralized lottery that allows users to participate by paying an entrance fee in USD. The fee is automatically converted to its equivalent value in ETH for participation in the lottery.

## Features

- **Decentralized Oracle Services**: 
  - Time tracking
  - Data feeds (e.g., USD to ETH price conversions)
  - Additional oracle-based functionalities

## How It Works

1. Users pay the entrance fee in USD.
2. The fee is converted into ETH via decentralized data feeds.
3. Participants are entered into the lottery.
4. Lottery results are determined based on oracle-provided randomness and time tracking.

## Technologies Used

- **Smart Contracts**: Implemented in Solidity.
- **Decentralized Oracles**: Utilized for:
  - Time tracking
  - Real-time data feeds
  - Randomized number generation
